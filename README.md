# Hello there!
Hi, I'm Simon. I study computer science at the Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg. In my freetime, I'm working on a cross platform render engine, the [Atlas Engine](https://github.com/tippesi/Atlas-Engine). One thing that is particularly interesting to me is the scalability across multiple platforms (Android, Linux and Windows).
I'm most interested in:
- Optimizing code
- Working on hard problems
- Graphics stuff
